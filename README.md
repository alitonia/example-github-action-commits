# Example GitHub Action with Commits

This is a strange GitHub action that automatically commits emoji images into your master branch.

Why would you want that? I have no idea.

The action and workflow both live in this repository (I haven't released this action... because again: _why_?). This is mostly here to demonstrate interactions with payloads, committing via the API and responding to issues. Steal liberally.

Open an issue... in the body create a list of emoji names (separated by commas). The action will automatically add them to the repo and close the issue.
